First, look up the (European Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Note that Articles 1-99 start on p. 32 of the document. We will refer to the articles and their parts by, e.g., "Art 6 (1) a) GDPR" which means Article 6 ("Lawfulness of processing"), first paragraph, item a in the GDPR.

## Valid Consent?

- Find a service you use to which you have given consent for the processing of your personal data (Art 6 (1) a) GDPR). Have a look at the privacy notices, policies, or settings of this service.

```

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
```

- Are the basic legal conditions for this consent in your opinion in line with the new requirements and conditions set by the GDPR?

- You should provide an answer with justification based on the GDPR, where you refer to specific articles and paragraphs.

Facebook has around eight different major topics about data privacy:
kind of information they collect, ways of using your information, how your
information is being shared, how can a user manage or delete personal
personal information, how Facebook will respond to legal requests, how Facebook's
global services operate, how Facebook will inform about changes to policy and 
lastly how user can contact to Facebook with their questions. 

Collectivily, Facebook will gather all the data you are not restricted it to 
gather. This includes data about how you interact with your network, data about 
the devices you use when logged to Facebook, times, dates and so on. Facebook
is saying that it uses this data to develop and improve its services e.g. by 
using location information. 

Also "We use your information to send you 
marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services and 
let you know about our policies and terms".

"Use measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads on and off our Services
and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services."

"investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies"

Facebook user information is shared in following ways:

"Public information is available to anyone on or off our Services and can be 
seen or accessed through online search engines, APIs, and offline media, such 
as on TV."


"Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the
audience they choose."

"When you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are 
integrated with, our Services, they may receive information about what you 
post or share."

"We share information we have about you within the family of companies that are 
part of Facebook." (Instagram, WhatsApp, Atlas [advertisement])

"If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets
changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner."


"With this in mind, we use all of the information we have about you to show
you relevant ads"

"we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed 
their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally
identifying demographic information"

"We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other partners who
globally support our business"

User can fetch the data by:

"your Facebook account through our Download Your Information tool."

"Information associated with your account will be kept until your account is 
deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services."


Facebook will respond to legal requests by:

"We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal
request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith
belief that the law requires us to do so."

"Information collected within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) may, 
for example, be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes as
described in this policy"

"We’ll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the
opportunity to review and comment on the revised policy before continuing to

"In the future, Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR outline changes for giving people 
information that's held about them. Article 13 covers where information about a 
person is collected after they provide it: the regulation says this should be 
handed-over when asked for and include how it is being used."

"Article 14 covers where information about a person has been collected but not 
explicitly provided by them – this could include combining data from third-party
sources. When requested, organisations will have to say what they hold, how it 
is being used, the types of personal data and how long it is being kept for."
